def show_intro():
    print('''
You, a fatalist explorer, have learned of an old manor house once occupied by a now-deceased eccentric autodidact 
rumored to have been the last true wizard to exist. The local lore suggests that the wizard possessed artifacts of 
significant power and value but that due to a maleficent curse, no soul has set foot in the manor since the 
ownerâ€™s death. Your research has led you to believe you can enter the house, collect these artifacts, dispel the 
curse, and safely leave. To do this, you plan to first collect the Relicarium Arcanum from the Library. This book 
should explain the nature of the artifacts, how to use them and where in the manor you might find them.
