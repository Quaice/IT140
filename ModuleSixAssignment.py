    significant power and value but that due to a maleficent curse, no soul has set foot in the manor since the 
    ownerâ€™s death. Your research has led you to believe you can enter the house, collect these artifacts, dispel the 
    curse, and safely leave. To do this, you plan to first collect the Relicarium Arcanum from the Library. This book 
    should explain the nature of the artifacts, how to use them and where in the manor you might find them.
